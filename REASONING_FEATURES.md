## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Chain-of-Thought Mode
```python
query = "What is the capital of France?"
result = reasoning_chain.execute_reasoning(query)
# Shows:
# THINKING:
# 1) Analyzing the question about France's capital
# 2) Recalling geographical knowledge
# 3) Verifying information
# 
# ANSWER:
# The capital of France is Paris.
```

### Multi-Step Mode
```python
query = "Explain how photosynthesis works"
result = multi_step.step_by_step_reasoning(query)
# Shows:
# ANALYSIS:
# 1) Process identification
# 2) Component breakdown
# 3) Sequential steps
#
# STEPS:
# 1) Light absorption
# 2) Water uptake
# 3) CO2 conversion
```

### Agent-Based Mode
```python
query = "What is the current Bitcoin price?"
result = agent.run(query)
# Shows:
# ü§î Thought: I should search for current Bitcoin price
# üîç Action: Using web_search
# üìù Result: [Current price information]
```
