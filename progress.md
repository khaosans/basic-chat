## 2025-07-03 — Deterministic Performance Regression Test for LLM Judge (by SourC)

- Added `scripts/test_performance_regression.py` to measure LLM Judge evaluation time and memory usage.
- Test fails if elapsed time > 30s or memory usage > 600MB (default, configurable).
- Integrated as a new job in CI after llm-judge, uploads `performance_metrics.json` artifact.
- Thresholds and rationale are documented in both the script and workflow.
- Ensures no performance regressions are merged.

# Progress Log

## [Date: YYYY-MM-DD]

- Added `scripts/generate_final_report.py` to aggregate test, coverage, LLM Judge, and performance results into a single Markdown report (`final_test_report.md`).
- Updated `.github/workflows/verify.yml` to run the report script after all tests and upload the report as an artifact for every job.
- The report includes: test summary, coverage, LLM Judge results, performance metrics, recommendations, and a stub for comparisons to previous runs.
- All steps are robust to missing files and always generate a report for CI/CD visibility.
