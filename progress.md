## 2025-07-03 ‚Äî Deterministic Performance Regression Test for LLM Judge (by SourC)

- Added `scripts/test_performance_regression.py` to measure LLM Judge evaluation time and memory usage.
- Test fails if elapsed time > 30s or memory usage > 600MB (default, configurable).
- Integrated as a new job in CI after llm-judge, uploads `performance_metrics.json` artifact.
- Thresholds and rationale are documented in both the script and workflow.
- Ensures no performance regressions are merged.

## 2025-07-03 ‚Äî Playwright E2E Testing Setup (by SourC)

- Created branch feature/playwright-e2e-testing for Playwright E2E testing setup
- Added package.json and playwright.config.ts for Playwright
- To be followed by E2E test suites, fixtures, and CI integration

# Progress Log

## [Date: YYYY-MM-DD]

- Added `scripts/generate_final_report.py` to aggregate test, coverage, LLM Judge, and performance results into a single Markdown report (`final_test_report.md`).
- Updated `.github/workflows/verify.yml` to run the report script after all tests and upload the report as an artifact for every job.
- The report includes: test summary, coverage, LLM Judge results, performance metrics, recommendations, and a stub for comparisons to previous runs.
- All steps are robust to missing files and always generate a report for CI/CD visibility.

# E2E Test Hardening & Infra Health Check (2024-06)

## üö¶ New: E2E Infra Health Check Script
- **File:** `scripts/e2e_health_check.py`
- **Purpose:** Checks if all required services are up before running E2E tests:
  - Streamlit app (`localhost:8501`)
  - Ollama API (`localhost:11434`, models: `mistral`, `nomic-embed-text`)
  - ChromaDB (`localhost:8000`)
  - Redis (`localhost:6379`)
- **Usage:**
  ```bash
  poetry run python scripts/e2e_health_check.py
  # or
  python scripts/e2e_health_check.py
  ```
- **Behavior:**
  - Prints ‚úÖ/‚ùå for each service
  - Fails fast with clear error if any service is down
  - Summary at the end (ALL SERVICES HEALTHY üü¢ or SOME SERVICES UNHEALTHY üî¥)

## üõ°Ô∏è E2E Selector Hardening & Retry Logic
- **Refactored:** `tests/e2e/specs/basic-e2e.spec.ts`
  - Uses robust `data-testid` selectors via `ChatHelper` for all main flows
  - DRY: All common actions (send message, upload, select mode) use helpers
  - Retry logic and explicit waits for LLM and document upload steps
- **Benefits:**
  - Less flakiness from UI changes or slow infra
  - Easier to maintain and debug

## üìù Best Practices
- **Always run the health check before E2E:**
  ```bash
  poetry run python scripts/e2e_health_check.py
  ```
- **If a test fails:**
  - Check the Playwright HTML report for logs/screenshots
  - Ensure all infra is up and healthy
  - If infra is slow, increase timeouts in helpers

## üèÅ Next Steps
- Harden other E2E specs to use helpers/selectors (optional)
- Add more health checks as needed (e.g., S3, Supabase)
- Keep this doc updated with new E2E patterns

# E2E Testing Progress & Best Practices

## ‚úÖ Always Use Local Code for E2E Tests

- [x] Start the app using local scripts (e.g., `./start_basicchat.sh` or `./start_dev.sh`)
- [x] Do NOT use Docker Compose or Docker images for E2E tests
- [x] Run E2E tests with `bunx playwright test --reporter=list` against the local app
- [x] In CI/CD, ensure the app is started from source, not from a Docker image
- [x] Double-check with `docker ps` that no containers are running for the app during E2E

---

## E2E Test Run Steps

1. Stop any running Docker containers for the app:
   ```sh
   docker ps
   # If any containers are running for the app:
   docker stop <container_id>
   ```
2. Start the app from source:
   ```sh
   ./start_basicchat.sh
   # or
   ./start_dev.sh
   ```
3. In a new terminal, run E2E tests:
   ```sh
   bunx playwright test --reporter=list
   ```

---

## CI/CD Note
- Ensure your pipeline installs dependencies and starts the app from source before running E2E tests.
- Do not use Docker images for E2E unless you are explicitly testing the container build.

_Last updated: Ensured E2E always runs against local code, not Docker images._
