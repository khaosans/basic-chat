## Overview
BasicChat employs a modern, layered architecture that combines asynchronous processing, intelligent caching, advanced reasoning capabilities, and persistent session management to deliver a high-performance AI assistant. The system is designed following established software engineering principles and incorporates research-based approaches to ensure scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

The architecture follows the microservices pattern while maintaining a cohesive, integrated experience. Each component is designed with clear interfaces and responsibilities, enabling independent development and testing while ensuring seamless integration. This approach is grounded in research on distributed systems and software architecture patterns (Fowler 2014, Bass et al. 2012).

### Key Architectural Principles

**Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has distinct responsibilities and communicates through well-defined interfaces, enabling modular development and testing. This follows the principle of loose coupling and high cohesion (Parnas 1972).

**Asynchronous Processing**: The system leverages modern async/await patterns for non-blocking operations, following research on concurrent programming and performance optimization (PEP 492, Fielding and Reschke 2014).

**Persistent State Management**: Session management provides conversation persistence with automatic schema migrations, following database design patterns for schema evolution (Kleppmann 2017).

**Intelligent Caching**: Multi-layer caching strategy optimizes response times while maintaining data consistency, based on research on hierarchical caching systems (Aggarwal et al. 1999).
