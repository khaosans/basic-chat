# BasicChat Documentation

This document provides a consolidated overview of the BasicChat application, including its architecture, features, and technical specifications.

## Architecture

BasicChat uses a layered microservices architecture that prioritizes privacy, performance, and extensibility. The system operates entirely locally while providing enterprise-grade AI capabilities.

**Diagram 1: System Architecture Overview**
This diagram illustrates the layered microservices architecture, showing the separation of concerns between the user interface, core logic, services, storage, and external integrations.

## Features

BasicChat's features are designed to provide a private, powerful, and user-friendly AI assistant.

### Reasoning Engine

The reasoning engine is the core of BasicChat, orchestrating various reasoning strategies and tools to provide accurate and well-explained answers.

```mermaid

    subgraph Input Layer
        QUERY[User Query]
        MODE[Reasoning Mode]
        CONTEXT[Document Context]
    end

```
**Diagram 2: Reasoning Engine Architecture**
This diagram shows how the reasoning engine processes user queries through various reasoning modes, utilizes a tool layer, and produces a structured output with the final answer, reasoning steps, and a confidence score.

### Document Processing

BasicChat can process and analyze documents, using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to provide answers based on the document's content.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "üìÑ Document Processing"
        UPLOAD[File Upload]
        EXTRACT[Text Extraction]
        CHUNK[Text Chunking]
        EMBED[Vector Embedding]
        STORE[Vector Storage]
        SEARCH[Semantic Search]
    end
    
    subgraph "üñºÔ∏è Image Processing"
        IMG[Image Upload]
        OCR[Vision Model OCR]
        DESC[Description Generation]
    end
    
    UPLOAD --> EXTRACT
    EXTRACT --> CHUNK
    CHUNK --> EMBED
    EMBED --> STORE
    STORE --> SEARCH
    
    IMG --> OCR
    OCR --> DESC
    DESC --> CHUNK
    
    classDef pipeline fill:#E3F2FD,stroke:#1976D2,stroke-width:2px,color:#0D47A1
    classDef image fill:#E8F5E8,stroke:#388E3C,stroke-width:2px,color:#1B5E20
    
    class UPLOAD,EXTRACT,CHUNK,EMBED,STORE,SEARCH pipeline
    class IMG,OCR,DESC image
```
**Diagram 3: Document Processing Pipeline**
This diagram shows how documents and images are processed for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Text and images are extracted, chunked, embedded, and stored for semantic search.

## Development

This section outlines the development and testing processes for BasicChat.

### Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite. Tests are organized by feature and can be run using `pytest`.

### CI/CD

The CI/CD pipeline is configured to run tests automatically on pushes and pull requests. It uses GitHub Actions to build, test, and evaluate the codebase.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Code Change] --> B(Run Tests)
    B --> C{Tests Pass?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Run LLM Judge]
    C -->|No| E[Fail]
    D --> F{Quality Score > 7.0?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Merge]
    F -->|No| H[Fail]
```
**Diagram 4: CI/CD Workflow**
This diagram shows the CI/CD pipeline, which includes running tests and an LLM Judge for quality assurance before merging code.
