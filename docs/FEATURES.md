**Diagram Narrative: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Process**

This diagram illustrates how complex queries are solved through sequential logical steps, showing the progression from user question through three thought stages to final answer. The chain-of-thought approach improves reasoning accuracy by making the AI's thought process explicit and verifiable, following the methodology established by Wei et al. (2022). Use this mode for analytical questions, mathematical problems, and logic puzzles where step-by-step reasoning enhances understanding.

**Example:**
```
User: "If I have 5 apples and give 2 to my friend, then buy 3 more, how many do I have?"

Chain-of-Thought:
1. Start with 5 apples
2. Give away 2: 5 - 2 = 3 apples
3. Buy 3 more: 3 + 3 = 6 apples
4. Final answer: 6 apples
```

#### **Multi-Step Reasoning**

```

</div>

**Diagram Narrative: Multi-Step Reasoning Process**

This diagram demonstrates how complex queries are decomposed into parallel sub-questions that are processed independently and then synthesized into comprehensive answers. The multi-step approach enables thorough analysis by addressing multiple aspects simultaneously, then integrating results for complete understanding. This method is particularly effective for research questions, comparative analysis, and complex topics requiring systematic exploration.
