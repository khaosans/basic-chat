This document provides detailed information about each feature and its capabilities, grounded in established research and best practices in artificial intelligence and software engineering.

## üß† Advanced Reasoning Engine

### Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
The implementation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning represents a significant advancement in AI problem-solving capabilities. This approach, pioneered by Wei et al., enables AI systems to break down complex problems into manageable steps, significantly improving accuracy on mathematical and logical reasoning tasks (Wei et al. 2201.11903).
