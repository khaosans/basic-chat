This document provides detailed information about each feature and its capabilities, grounded in established research and best practices in artificial intelligence and software engineering.

## üß† Advanced Reasoning Engine

### Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
The implementation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning represents a significant advancement in AI problem-solving capabilities. This approach, pioneered by Wei et al., enables AI systems to break down complex problems into manageable steps, significantly improving accuracy on mathematical and logical reasoning tasks (Wei et al. 2201.11903).

- **Step-by-step analysis** with visible thought process
- **Research-based**: Inspired by Wei et al. (2022) showing improved reasoning accuracy
- **Streaming output** with real-time step visualization
- **Confidence scoring** for transparency in AI decisions

The CoT implementation follows the theoretical framework established by Kojima et al., who demonstrated that explicit reasoning steps can be elicited from large language models through carefully crafted prompts (Kojima et al. 2205.09656). Our system extends this approach by providing real-time streaming of reasoning steps, allowing users to observe the AI's thought process as it unfolds.

### Multi-Step Reasoning
Multi-step reasoning represents an evolution beyond simple CoT, incorporating systematic problem decomposition and context-aware processing. This approach is particularly effective for complex, multi-faceted problems that require gathering information from multiple sources.

- **Systematic problem decomposition** with query analysis phase

The multi-step approach draws from research on problem decomposition in AI systems, particularly the work of Zhou et al. on structured reasoning chains (Zhou et al. 2203.11171). Our implementation adds document context awareness, enabling the system to incorporate relevant information from uploaded documents during the reasoning process.

### Agent-Based Reasoning
Agent-based reasoning represents the most sophisticated approach, combining multiple specialized tools with dynamic selection capabilities. This architecture follows the principles outlined in the Toolformer research by Schick et al., demonstrating how language models can effectively use external tools (Schick et al. 2302.04761).
