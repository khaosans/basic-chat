**Diagram Narrative: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Process**

This diagram illustrates how complex queries are solved through sequential logical steps, showing the progression from user question through three thought stages to final answer. The chain-of-thought approach improves reasoning accuracy by making the AI's thought process explicit and verifiable, following the methodology established by Wei et al. (2022). Use this mode for analytical questions, mathematical problems, and logic puzzles where step-by-step reasoning enhances understanding.

**Example:**
```
User: "If I have 5 apples and give 2 to my friend, then buy 3 more, how many do I have?"

Chain-of-Thought:
1. Start with 5 apples
2. Give away 2: 5 - 2 = 3 apples
3. Buy 3 more: 3 + 3 = 6 apples
4. Final answer: 6 apples
```

**Diagram Narrative: Multi-Step Reasoning Process**

This diagram demonstrates the multi-step reasoning approach that breaks complex queries into analysis, reasoning, and synthesis phases while integrating document context through semantic search. The process enables comprehensive analysis by addressing multiple aspects systematically, then synthesizing results into coherent answers. This method is particularly effective for research questions and complex topics requiring thorough exploration and contextual understanding.

### **Local & Private Processing**

- **üîí Complete Privacy**: All processing happens on your local machine
- **üåê No External APIs**: Except for optional web search queries
- **üìä No Data Collection**: No telemetry or usage tracking
- **üîê Secure by Design**: Built with privacy as a core principle

**Privacy Implementation Details:**
The privacy-first design is implemented through multiple layers of protection. All data processing occurs locally using Ollama's local LLM inference, ensuring that sensitive information never leaves the user's machine. The system implements secure memory management that automatically clears sensitive data from memory after processing. File uploads are processed locally with no external transmission, and the vector database is stored locally with optional encryption. Web search queries are the only external API calls, and these are made through privacy-preserving DuckDuckGo integration that doesn't require API keys or user identification.

**Security Measures:**
- Input validation prevents injection attacks and malicious code execution
- Expression sanitization in the calculator prevents code injection
- Rate limiting protects against abuse and resource exhaustion
- Session isolation ensures no cross-user data access
- Automatic cleanup removes temporary files and cache entries

**Diagram Narrative: Advanced RAG Pipeline**

This diagram shows the retrieval-augmented generation pipeline where documents are processed through extraction, chunking, embedding, and storage phases, then retrieved for contextual answer generation. The RAG approach combines the reliability of document-based information with the flexibility of LLM reasoning, providing accurate answers grounded in specific source material (Lewis et al.). Optimize chunk sizes and embedding parameters based on your document types for optimal retrieval accuracy.

**RAG Performance Optimization:**
The RAG pipeline is optimized for both accuracy and speed through several key design decisions. The chunk size of 1000 characters balances retrieval precision with processing efficiency, while the 200-character overlap maintains context continuity across chunks. The system uses nomic-embed-text embeddings which provide excellent semantic understanding while maintaining reasonable computational requirements. Retrieval is optimized using a hybrid approach that combines dense vector similarity with sparse keyword matching, ensuring comprehensive coverage of relevant information (Johnson et al.).

**Chunking Strategy:**
The intelligent chunking algorithm uses a hierarchical approach that first attempts to split on natural boundaries (paragraphs, sentences), then falls back to character-based splitting when necessary. This approach maintains semantic coherence while ensuring optimal chunk sizes for retrieval. The system also implements metadata preservation, tracking source information and chunk relationships to enable accurate attribution and context reconstruction.

### **Intelligent Text Chunking**

- **Recursive Splitting**: Maintains semantic coherence
- **Overlap Strategy**: 200-character overlap for context continuity
- **Size Optimization**: 1000-character chunks for optimal retrieval
- **Metadata Preservation**: Source tracking and chunk relationships

### **Vision Model Integration**

    IMG --> ENCODE
    ENCODE --> VISION
    VISION --> DESC
    VISION --> TEXT
    DESC --> CHUNK
    TEXT --> CHUNK
```

**Diagram Narrative: Vision Model Integration**

This diagram illustrates how images are processed through vision models to extract both textual and visual information, enabling comprehensive understanding of image content for RAG applications. The dual-output approach combines OCR capabilities with visual description generation, ensuring complete content analysis regardless of image type. Ensure the vision model (llava) is properly installed and configured for optimal image processing performance and accuracy.

**Capabilities:**
- **Text Recognition**: OCR for text within images
